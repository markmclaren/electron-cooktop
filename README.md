# XML Cooktop - Electron Edition

**Experimental Project Disclaimer**

This project is an experiment and is provided strictly as-is for personal, educational, or research use. It is not suitable for commercial use without purchasing the appropriate licenses from Saxonica for SaxonJS and xslt3. See the Saxonica licensing terms for details: https://www.saxonica.com/license/index.xml


## Technology Overview & Mechanisms

### Formatting
XML and XSLT documents are formatted using the `xml-formatter` library, which is bundled for browser use via webpack. This ensures fast, client-side formatting with proper indentation and line breaks.

### Validation
XML validation is performed using `fast-xml-parser`, providing real-time error detection and line/column reporting. Validation errors are highlighted in the Monaco Editor for immediate feedback.

### Transformation
XSLT 3.0 transformations are handled by SaxonJS (`saxon-js` npm package) and the `xslt3` CLI/compiler. At runtime, XSLT stylesheets are compiled to SEF (Stylesheet Export File) using xslt3, and then executed in-process with SaxonJS. This enables robust, standards-compliant XSLT 3.0 support without requiring Java.

#### Mechanism Summary
- **Formatting:** `xml-formatter` (bundled via webpack)
- **Validation:** `fast-xml-parser` (real-time, with Monaco highlighting)
- **Transformation:** `saxon-js` + `xslt3` (XSLT 3.0, SEF compilation at runtime)

## Saxonica & SaxonJS Licensing

This application uses SaxonJS and xslt3 from Saxonica Limited for XSLT 3.0 transformation. SaxonJS is free for non-commercial use, but commercial use may require a license. Please review the [Saxonica licensing terms](https://www.saxonica.com/license/index.xml) and [SaxonJS documentation](https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-js/documentation/index.html) before distributing or using this application commercially.

# XML Cooktop - Electron Edition

A faithful recreation of the original XML Cooktop application by Victor Pavlov, built with modern web technologies for cross-platform compatibility. This Electron-based version preserves the iconic multi-pane "cooktop" interface that made the original application so powerful for XML and XSLT development.

## The "Cooktop" Interface

The heart of XML Cooktop is its unique multi-pane interface, which provides dedicated spaces for different aspects of XML/XSLT development:

- **Source (XML)**: Edit your XML documents with syntax highlighting
- **XPath Console**: Test and debug XPath expressions interactively  
- **Stylesheet (XSL)**: Create and edit XSLT transformations
- **Result**: View the XML output of XSLT transformations
- **Result (HTML)**: Preview HTML output in a live browser view

This layout allows you to work with XML, XSLT, and see results simultaneously - the essence of what made XML Cooktop a beloved tool for XML developers.

## Features

### Multi-Pane Cooktop Interface
- **Tabbed Pane System**: Switch between source XML, XPath console, XSLT stylesheet, result, and HTML preview
- **Live XSLT Processing**: Transform XML with XSLT and see results immediately
- **Integrated XPath Testing**: Evaluate XPath expressions against your XML documents
- **HTML Preview**: See HTML output rendered in real-time

### Professional XML Editing
- **Monaco Editor**: The same editor that powers VS Code, with XML/XSLT syntax highlighting
- **Code Completion**: IntelliSense support for XML and XSLT elements
- **Error Detection**: Real-time validation and error highlighting
- **Auto-formatting**: Format XML and XSLT documents with proper indentation

### Template System ("Code Bits")
- **126 Built-in Templates**: Converted from the original XML Cooktop template library
- **25 Template Categories**: DTD, XSLT Elements, XSLT Functions, XPath, XML, HTML, CSS, and more
- **Quick Insertion**: Click to insert templates at cursor position
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Templates organized in expandable folders


### XSLT Processing Engine
- **SaxonJS XSLT 3.0 Processor**: Modern, standards-compliant XSLT engine (see above)
- **Multiple Output Options**: 
  - View results in the result pane
  - Preview HTML in integrated browser
  - Save results to file
  - Open results in default browser
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages for XSLT transformation issues


## Installation

### The Cooktop Workflow
1. **Edit XML**: Start in the "source (xml)" pane to create or edit your XML document
2. **Create XSLT**: Switch to "stylesheet(xsl)" to write your transformation
3. **Test XPath**: Use the "xpath console" to test expressions against your XML
4. **Transform**: Click "Run XSLT" to see the transformation results
5. **Preview**: Check the "result(html)" pane to see HTML output rendered
